    The core of Renewed Tab is the widget system.
    You can add, move, resize, and configure widgets on a grid using intuitive
    controls.

    Choose from many widgets, including:
    RSS and Atom feeds, the Weather, Quick Links, Top Sites, Daily Goals, Notes,
    your current Age, Search bars, Web Comics, and upcoming Space Flights.

    You can place the same type of widget multiple times, with different settings.

    You can also choose a solid color, custom collections from Unsplash,
    or a custom background image.

    Each widget can be configured, and background settings can be changed.

    Customisation is at the heart of Renewed Tab, and it will continue to be
    developed to increase the possibilities.
