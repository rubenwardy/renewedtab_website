    The core of Renewed Tab is the widget system.
    You can add, move, resize, and configure widgets on a grid using intuitive
    controls.

    You can place the same type of widget multiple times, with different settings.

    You can also choose a solid color,
    an Unsplash collection,
    an RSS/Atom feed, or a custom background image.

    You can hide the widgets by hovering over the credits,
    and also like and skip images.

    Some widgets are Internet connected. For example, you can browse
    an RSS/Atom feed, see upcoming space launches, and check the weather.
