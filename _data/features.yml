    The core of Renewed Tab is the widget system.
    You can add, move, resize, and configure widgets on a grid using intuitive
    controls.

    You can place the same type of widget multiple times, with different settings.

    Some widgets are Internet connected, allowing you to load an RSS/Atom
    feed or see the weather.

    or a custom background image.

    Each widget has settings for behaviour and theming.

    There are also global settings, allowing you to customise the theme,
    change language, or choose a background.
