    Even though it is fairly new, Renewed Tab has a polished interface, and is
    more customizable than Tabliss and Mue. In fact, it is the only extension
    (of its kind) in the list that allows you to reposition your widgets.

    Amazing add-on! It has a clean looking aesthetic to the UI and widgets
    within the page. I have full control over the widgets that exist on the
    page. (Can remove everything individually to create a blank page).

    Incredible, it's pretty and the backgrounds are beautiful, it lets me have
    rss feeds, the weather in my area (with OSM), obviously a search bar and
    bookmarks.

    Amazing. All these months I was searching for a dashboard-like extension
    that could take widgets, notes etc and be beautifully designed like
    "Momentum". And here it is, ready and open-source too. Thank you!!

    Easy to use, has a whole bunch of useful, customizable widgets, and a few
    great ways to customize the background. For example, have you ever searched
    for an Art Deco theme on the Chrome Web Store and found a whole bunch of
    nothing? Renewed Tab+Unsplash is your friend now.

    Amazing. This one is easy to customize, beautiful, and more importantly
    (personally) lightweight. And this is open-source too, I give this 5 thumbs
    up.

    The only extension for newtab tab that comes close to iChrome. Keep up the good work!
