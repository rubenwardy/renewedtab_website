    Incredible, it's pretty and the backgrounds are beautiful, it lets me have
    rss feeds, the weather in my area (with OSM), obviously a search engine and
    bookmarks.

    Amazing. All these months I was searching for a dashboard-like extension
    that could take widgets, notes etc and be beautifully designed like
    "Momentum". And here it is, ready and open-source too. Thank you!!

    Easy to use, has a whole bunch of useful, customizable widgets, and a few
    great ways to customize the background. For example, have you ever searched
    for an Art Deco theme on the Chrome Web Store and found a whole bunch of
    nothing? Renewed Tab+Unsplash is your friend now.

    Amazing. This one is easy to customize, beautiful, and more importantly
    (personally) lightweight. And this is open-source too, I give this 5 thumbs
    up.
