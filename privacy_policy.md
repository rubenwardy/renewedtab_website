# Privacy Policy


## What information is collected and how is it used?

HTTP requests are logged, with the following information:

* Time
* IP address
* Page URL and query arguments
* Response status code

Logged HTTP requests may be used for debugging.

In order to look up latitude and longitude, the weather widget will send
location queries to the API server. The API server will then use
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) to look up this information,
but does so in a way only the location query is sent - user IP addresses aren't
shared. Location queries will be logged as above.


## Third-party Services

Your computer may directly contact third-party websites as part of this service.

Background images will load directly from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) or
from the URL you specify.

Widgets such as the Feed widget may fetch
information directly from the specified website.


## Location

The production server is currently in Germany.
By using this service, you give permission for the data to be moved as needed.


## Period of Retention

The server uses log rotation, meaning that any logged HTTP requests will be
forgotten about within a week.


## Future Changes to Privacy Policy

We will alert you to any future changes to the privacy policy on this website.

By continuing to use this service, you agree to the privacy policy.
