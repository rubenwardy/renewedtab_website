Renewed Tab 1.17 is now available, including OPML feed importing, setting icons,
and Chrome manifest v3 support.

<!-- more -->


## Import and exporting feed subscriptions using OPML

The Feed widget now supports importing and exporting OPML files. OPML is a
common format for exchanging feed subscriptions between feed readers.

You can use OPML to
<a href="/blog/2023/04/01/import-feeds-from-feedly/">import feeds from Feedly</a>
or another newsfeed aggregator.


## Other changes

In the Feed widget, you can now double click a tab to go to the website.

The settings tab now has icons, adding a bit of polish.

Renewed Tab now uses Manifest v3 on Chrome, which is the new extension API
that will become required later this year.


## Thanks

A small release again, I needed to release some bug fixes and through in a few
features as well.

Next, I'll be continuing the Calendar Schedule widget, working on improving
performance of loading feeds and backgrounds, and improving the feed widget
user experience.
