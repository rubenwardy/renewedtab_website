I have released Renewed Tab 1.16 today! It's taken longer than I would have
liked due to available time.

<!-- more -->


## Clock Time Zone

The release includes a time zone setting for clocks. You can use this to fix the
time when Renewed Tab doesn't detect it correctly, or to show clocks for
different parts of the world.


## Coming Soon: Calendar Schedule

By far the biggest thing I have been working on is a new Calendar Schedule
widget. Unfortunately, there's still some final things to iron out before I
include this in a release.

The widget allows you to see upcoming events in your calendar. Because it uses
the iCal standard, you can automatically synchronise it with many different
calendar services - including Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud. It even
supports showing events from multiple calendars.

## Thanks

Small release this time, but I wanted to release the clock time zone as it's
long over due.

Next, I'll be continuing the Calendar Schedule widget. I also plan to improve
the User Experience of finding feeds, including a new UI to select a feed and
support for importing feeds from OPML files.
