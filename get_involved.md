## Donate

I created Renewed Tab after being disappointed with the existing options.
They either had a bad user experience, none of the features I wanted, or
they locked _basic_ features behind a paywall.

I decided to release Renewed Tab for free and as
<a href="https://gitlab.com/rubenwardy/renewedtab/">open source software</a>,
allowing anyone to see its code and create their own versions.
This, as well as the fact that I don't want to lock features behind a paywall,
means that my monetisation techniques are limited.

Whilst I'm currently able to use free APIs for Renewed Tab, I will need to pay
for APIs when it becomes more popular. Donating helps cover this cost, and is
also a way to say thank you.

For a one-off donation, you can use Patreon and cancel after one month.
