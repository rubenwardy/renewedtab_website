## Donate

I created Renewed Tab after being disappointed with the existing options.
They either had a bad user experience, none of the features I wanted, or
they locked _basic_ features behind a paywall.

I decided to release Renewed Tab for free and as
<a href="https://gitlab.com/renewedtab/renewedtab/">open source software</a>,
allowing anyone to see its code and create their own versions.
This, as well as the fact that I don't want to lock features behind a paywall,
means that my monetisation techniques are limited.

I currently pay $25 per month for the Weather API, and $20 per month on hosting.

For a one-off donation, you can subscribe and cancel after one month.
